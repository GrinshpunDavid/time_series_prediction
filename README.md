## Project description
Sweet Lift Taxi company has collected historical data on taxi orders at airports. 
To attract more drivers during peak hours, we need to predict the amount of taxi orders for the next hour. 
Build a model for such a prediction.

## Target:
The RMSE metric on the test set should not be more than 48.

## Project steps:
- Resample the data timescale to an hourly one.
- Preform analysis of the data.
- Features engineering.
- Train different models with different hyperparameters. 
- Test the data using the test sample.
- Provide a conclusion.

## Conclusion:
- I reached test RMSE of 44 by applying features engineering and 'RandomForestRegressor' as the model.
